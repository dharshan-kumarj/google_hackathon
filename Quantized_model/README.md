## Offline Menu Translator üçú
A simple Flutter application that demonstrates the power of on-device, offline, multimodal AI using the `flutter_gemma` package. This app can translate a Japanese menu from an image, even without an internet connection.

This project was built as a proof-of-concept for my Medium article, which details the entire journey and implementation.
